**What is Open Source?**  
Open source means the source code of a program or software is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share. It’s like a recipe that anyone can see, tweak, and share with others. Open-source software is often built by communities of developers who work together to improve it.

**Why is Open Source Awesome?**

1. **Free to Use:** Most open-source tools don’t cost money.
2. **Customizable:** You can change the software to fit your needs.
3. **Secure:** Because the code is open, many people can check for bugs or security issues.
4. **Community Support:** If you have questions or problems, there’s usually a large community ready to help.
5. **Learning Opportunity:** Open-source software helps you learn how things work under the hood.
