**Git** is a powerful tool used to track changes in code and collaborate on software projects. It helps developers save versions of their work and makes it easy to share and merge code with others. Git is open-source and widely used in programming, especially in teamwork and open-source projects.

### **Why Use Git?**

1. **Version Control:**  
    Keeps a history of your code changes, so you can go back to earlier versions if needed.
    
2. **Collaboration:**  
    Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes.
    
3. **Backup:**  
    Your code is safe, even if something happens to your computer, as it can be stored in remote repositories like **GitHub**.
    
4. **Branching:**  
    Create separate branches to test new features without affecting the main code.

### **How Git Works**

1. **Repository (Repo):**  
    A folder where Git tracks your code.
    
2. **Stages:**
    
    - **Working Directory:** Where you write and edit code.
    - **Staging Area:** Where you prepare changes before saving them.
    - **Commit:** A snapshot of your changes saved to the repo.
3. **Remote Repository:**  
    A version of your project stored online, like on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, for sharing and backup.

### **Basic Git Commands**

1. **Setup Git:**
    
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    ```
    
2. **Initialize a Repo:**
    
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    
    Turns a folder into a Git-tracked repository.
    
3. **Check Status:**
    
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    
    Shows changes and the current state of the repo.
    
4. **Add Changes to Staging:**
    
    ```bash
    git add file.txt
    ```
    
    Adds specific changes, or use `git add .` to add all changes.
    
5. **Commit Changes:**
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Describe your changes"
    ```
    
    Saves the changes in the repo with a message.
    
6. **View History:**
    
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
    
    Shows all past commits.
    
7. **Connect to a Remote Repo (GitHub):**
    
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
    ```
    
8. **Push Changes to Remote Repo:**
    
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
    
    Sends your changes online.
    
9. **Pull Changes:**
    
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
    
    Updates your local repo with changes from the remote repo.
    
10. **Create and Switch to a Branch:**
    
    ```bash
    git branch new-feature
    git checkout new-feature
    ```
