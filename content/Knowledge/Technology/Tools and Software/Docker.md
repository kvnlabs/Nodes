**Docker** is a tool that makes it easy to create, share, and run applications in **containers**. Containers are like lightweight, portable "mini-computers" that hold everything your app needs to work, such as code, libraries, and dependencies, so it can run anywhere without issues.

### **Why Use Docker?**

1. **Consistency Across Environments:**  
    Apps run the same on any computer, server, or cloud, avoiding the "it works on my machine" problem.
    
2. **Lightweight:**  
    Containers share the host system’s resources, making them faster and smaller than virtual machines.
    
3. **Easy Collaboration:**  
    Developers can share their work as a single container file, making teamwork simple.
    
4. **Quick Setup:**  
    You can set up an app and its dependencies in minutes using Docker.
    
5. **Scalability:**  
    Docker is great for deploying apps in large-scale systems or cloud environments.

### **How Does Docker Work?**

1. **Docker Image:**  
    A blueprint of your application and its environment. Think of it as a "snapshot" of everything needed to run your app.
    
2. **Docker Container:**  
    A running instance of a Docker image. It’s like launching an app using the blueprint.
    
3. **Docker Hub:**  
    A public repository where you can find ready-made images or share your own.

### **Basic Commands to Get Started**

1. **Install Docker:**  
    Download and install Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).
    
2. **Run a Container:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```
    
    This command runs a basic container to check if Docker is working.
    
3. **List Containers:**
    
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    
    Shows all running containers.
    
4. **Stop a Container:**
    
    ```bash
    docker stop <container-id>
    ```
    
5. **Pull an Image from Docker Hub:**
    
    ```bash
    docker pull ubuntu
    ```
    
    Downloads the Ubuntu container image.
    
6. **Build Your Own Image:**  
    Create a `Dockerfile` (instructions for building your app) and run:
    
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-app .
    ```
