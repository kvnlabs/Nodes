**My Journey with Arc Browser and Finding Zen Browser**

I first discovered **[Arc Browser](

)** through a recommendation from a college friend. As someone who loves exploring new technologies, I decided to give it a try. However, my first impression wasn’t exactly great. Arc’s design and interface were so new and different from what I was used to that it initially felt overwhelming. It wasn’t the smoothest experience right away, especially since Arc had a lot of unique features that I wasn’t familiar with.

Arc has a completely different approach to how we interact with the web. Instead of the traditional top tab bar, Arc uses a **side navigation panel**. This lets you manage tabs and browsing sessions in a much more flexible and organized way. The **Spaces** feature, for example, allows you to create separate workspaces for different tasks—so you could have one space for work, one for personal browsing, and so on. I found this idea intriguing, as it helped me keep things more organized.

Despite the rocky start, I stuck with it. I liked how Arc didn’t just feel like another browser. It felt more like a creative workspace where I could interact with the web in a way that was more suited to my needs. I found myself gradually adjusting to the new layout and appreciating its fluid design. Even though Arc was still in its **beta** stage, I decided to make it my **default browser**.

Eventually, **Arc** reached a stable version for **Windows**, and I was excited to see it evolve. As someone who had been using it since the beta days, it was satisfying to see how much better it had become. In fact, I even saw my name appear on the [**Arc Windows Tester website**](

) as part of the early testers. It felt great to be a part of that journey. Still, there were a few bugs and missing features, but overall, it was a fun and unique experience.

However, despite all the improvements, I found that there were some aspects of Arc that didn’t fully match my needs. One feature I loved about Arc was its **horizontal tab style**, which made it visually easier to manage and organize multiple tabs. But as I explored further, I realized I couldn’t quite let go of that tab style. That’s when I started looking for other browsers that offered a similar experience.

That’s when I found **[[Zen-Browser]]**. Zen is similar to Arc in many ways, especially in terms of design and how it handles tabs. But what sets Zen apart is that it's built on top of [[**Firefox**]], which gives it a strong foundation in privacy and speed. Zen aims to offer a browsing experience that is visually organized and streamlined, just like Arc. However, Zen is still in its **alpha stage**, which means it's not yet as stable as Arc or other mainstream browsers.

I found Zen Browser to be a great alternative, as it provided the horizontal tab layout I loved, while also offering the privacy features of Firefox. Even though it’s in its early stages and has its share of bugs, I can see its potential to grow into a powerful browser.

**Final Thoughts**

In conclusion, **Arc Browser** was a unique and refreshing change from traditional browsers, with its focus on design, organization, and creativity. Despite a few bugs and missing features, it became my default browser as I enjoyed its streamlined, organized approach to browsing. However, when I started missing the horizontal tab layout, I found **[[Zen-Browser]]** to be a great alternative. Even though Zen is in its alpha stage, it offers many of the features I loved in Arc, and since it’s built on Firefox, it’s also privacy-focused.

As Zen continues to evolve, I’m excited to see how it develops, and I’m curious to see whether it will become my new go-to browser for the long term.
