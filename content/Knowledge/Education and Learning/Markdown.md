Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to display content on the web in a simple way. It's the most popular markup language because it's the easiest to get started with.

Markdown has different "flavours" or implementations that are slightly different in syntax. [[Obsidian]] notes are based on Markdown and are saved as `.md` files.

Almost every web site we use regularly is written at least partially in some form of HTML. The problem is that HTML looks like this-- not exactly the most friendly for reading OR writing.

The format called Markdown was created as a more readable _and_ writable alternative to HTML, but it isn't a direct replacement. Instead, it's kind of like another layer entirely: you write in something that looks pretty much like human prose, with minimal marks that format the text in some way.

At some point, Markdown is _rendered_: this is what's happening when you switch from source mode to Live Preview in Obsidian. This is also what's happening when you blog-- all the major blogging platforms take Markdown text and convert it into HTML. So HTML is better for displaying formatted text online, but Markdown is better when you're writing and reading in plain, unformatted text.


## Headings 

```markdown
# This is heading 1
## This is heading 2
### This is heading 3
```

Looks like this:

## Creating and embedding links 

### Link to Obsidian note 

```markdown

```



### Link to note but with link text

```



### Link to a public website 

```markdown

### Link to paragraph in note: 

```markdown

### Embed note or part of notes 

Same as the previous five, but add a `!` at the start like:

```markdown

```



## What's here? 

- [[Obsidian]]contains information on different features and how to use them.
