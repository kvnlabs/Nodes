I've Started Reading ikigai  and its my 1st physical book apart from the academic books,


## Key Points
### Chapter 1 - Ikigai
This Chapter Says about the art of staying young while growing old

### Chapter 2 - Antiaging Secrets
This Chapter Says about little things that add up to a long and happy life


### Chapter 3 - From Logotherapy to Ikigai
This Chapter Says about how to live longer and better by finding your purpose
(it contains some chapter 2's points and its boring to me)

### Chapter 4 - Find Flow in Everything You Do

This Chapter says How to turn work and free time into spaces
